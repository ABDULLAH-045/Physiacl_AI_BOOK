# Chapter 2: Gazebo Essentials for Physical AI Simulation

This chapter is dedicated to equipping you with the essential skills to simulate a humanoid robot within a high-fidelity, physics-driven environment using Gazebo. Gazebo serves as a critical sandbox for developing and testing Physical AI algorithms, allowing for rapid iteration and safe experimentation before deployment on real hardware.

You will cover essential topics such as installing and configuring Gazebo Harmonic, importing complex URDF models (like those for humanoids), setting detailed joint dynamics, and implementing PID controllers for precise humanoid movement. We will explore critical physics parameters like gravity, friction, and surface properties, along with advanced concepts in collision detection and contact sensors—all vital for realistic physical interaction. Furthermore, you'll learn to simulate torques, understand the crucial role of the center of mass in stability, effectively bridge ROS 2 with Gazebo, and run ROS 2 nodes directly within a Gazebo world, creating a fully integrated simulation environment. Hands-on activities will involve loading your humanoid URDF in Gazebo and programming the robot to perform foundational Physical AI behaviors: stand, walk, fall, and recover, providing invaluable experience for developing robust and intelligent physical systems.
