# Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation for Physical AI Perception

For humanoid robots to exhibit true Physical AI, they must accurately perceive their environment. This chapter focuses on the critical aspect of simulating crucial robot sensors within your digital twin, providing the rich, realistic data necessary to train and validate advanced AI perception models.

You will learn to simulate a range of essential sensors, including LiDAR (with realistic 2D/3D scanning and adjustable range noise models), depth cameras (generating RGB-D images and dense point clouds vital for 3D reconstruction and object recognition), stereo vision systems, IMUs (inertial measurement units, providing angular velocity and linear acceleration for stability and pose estimation), and force/torque sensors at joints (crucial for dexterous manipulation and physical interaction). We will cover how these simulated sensors accurately output data into standard ROS Topics (e.g., `/camera/depth/image_raw`), PointCloud2, LaserScan, and IMU messages, seamlessly integrating with your ROS 2-based AI systems. You will gain practical experience in creating and configuring sensor plugins, strategically attaching sensors to the robot's head, chest, or extremities, and visualizing their real-time outputs in RViz2, thus building the foundational perceptual capabilities for intelligent humanoid robots.
