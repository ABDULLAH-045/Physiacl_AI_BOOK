# Chapter 2: Isaac Sim Foundations for Physical AI Training

Building intelligent humanoid robots that can operate effectively in diverse real-world environments requires robust and realistic simulation. This chapter lays the foundation for using Isaac Sim, NVIDIA's powerful robotics simulation platform, as a cornerstone for Physical AI development.

You will learn how to install Isaac Sim, seamlessly import complex humanoid URDF models into the Omniverse environment, and meticulously configure essential physical and visual properties like materials, realistic physics, and precise joint dynamics—all crucial for high-fidelity simulations. We will delve into advanced simulation techniques such as Domain Randomization (including variations in lighting, textures, and object positions) and strategic scene building, specifically tailored for generating diverse training data for Physical AI models. Hands-on exercises will guide you through creating a photorealistic home environment and simulating complex humanoid locomotion (e.g., dynamic walking, running, navigating stairs) and intricate manipulation tasks (e.g., grasping, placing, tool use), providing an indispensable sandbox for developing and validating robust AI behaviors for humanoid robots.
