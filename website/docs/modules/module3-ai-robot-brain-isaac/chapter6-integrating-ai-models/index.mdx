# Chapter 6: Integrating Advanced AI Models for Humanoid Physical AI

The ultimate goal of Physical AI is to imbue humanoid robots with human-like cognitive capabilities, enabling them to perceive, reason, and act intelligently in complex environments. This chapter focuses on the crucial process of integrating advanced Artificial Intelligence models into your robotics systems, transforming raw sensor data into actionable insights.

You will gain practical experience in integrating a variety of state-of-the-art AI models, including image classification for recognizing objects, robust object detection models for pinpointing their location and identity, and precise pose tracking for understanding human intentions and robot body configurations. We will also explore custom training pipelines, guiding you through the end-to-end process of developing and deploying specialized AI models. This includes converting models from popular frameworks like PyTorch to optimized formats like ONNX, and then integrating them seamlessly into ROS 2 environments using Isaac ROS for real-time inference in real-world robotic applications. This foundational knowledge is essential for building humanoid robots that can truly understand and intelligently respond to their surroundings.
