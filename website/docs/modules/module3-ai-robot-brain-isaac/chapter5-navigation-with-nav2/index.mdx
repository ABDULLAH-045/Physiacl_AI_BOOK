# Chapter 5: Advanced Navigation with Nav2 for Humanoid Physical AI

Autonomous navigation is a cornerstone of Physical AI, particularly for bipedal humanoids operating in complex, unstructured environments. This chapter focuses on advanced navigation techniques, leveraging the powerful Nav2 framework, tailored specifically for the unique challenges of humanoid locomotion.

You will learn about robust mapping and localization strategies essential for a humanoid robot to accurately understand its position and surroundings. We will delve into sophisticated path planning algorithms that account for the humanoid's kinematics and dynamics, along with effective obstacle avoidance strategies crucial for safe and efficient movement. A key focus will be on specialized footstep planning, a critical component for stable bipedal systems, and exploring crucial stability considerations unique to humanoid robots (e.g., maintaining balance during motion, recovering from perturbations). A challenging mini-task will push you to program a "Humanoid walks across home avoiding a moving obstacle," requiring you to apply all learned navigation concepts to create an intelligent, physically aware autonomous agent.
