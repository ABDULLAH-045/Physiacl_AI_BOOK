# Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Physical AI

Welcome to the forefront of Physical AI! This module teaches you how Large Language Models (LLMs), advanced perception systems, and precise robotic control converge to form the modern "robot brain" capable of understanding and executing human-like commands in the physical world. This is the essence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA), enabling humanoid robots to process complex requests and translate them into physical action.

You will gain hands-on experience integrating state-of-the-art technologies such as Whisper (for speech-to-text), powerful OpenAI models (for natural language understanding and planning), and the ROS 2 framework (for robust robot control). The ultimate goal is to build a complete humanoid system that can interpret natural language commands and intelligently plan and execute actions, bridging the gap between human intent and robotic capability for embodied intelligence.
