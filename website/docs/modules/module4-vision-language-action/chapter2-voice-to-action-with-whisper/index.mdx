# Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action with Whisper for Natural Human-Robot Interaction

Enabling humanoid robots to understand and respond to natural spoken language is a cornerstone of advanced Physical AI. This chapter guides you through implementing robust voice-to-action capabilities in your robot using OpenAI's highly capable Whisper model.

You will learn to build a dedicated Whisper inference node within your ROS 2 ecosystem, allowing your robot to accurately transcribe human speech into text. We will then explore how to develop custom vocabularies tailored for common household commands or specific industrial tasks, enhancing the robot's ability to interpret context. The chapter covers performing robust command classification to translate transcribed speech into executable robotic actions, ultimately achieving real-time speech control for a wide array of robotic tasks. Practical examples will include intuitive voice commands like "Pick the red bottle" or "Turn on the living room light," fostering a more natural and efficient human-robot interaction essential for intelligent physical agents.
