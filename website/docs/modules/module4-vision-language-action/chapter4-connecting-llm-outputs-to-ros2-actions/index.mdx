# Chapter 4: Orchestrating Physical AI: Connecting LLM Outputs to ROS 2 Actions

The ultimate challenge in Physical AI and humanoid robotics is transforming abstract intelligence from Large Language Models (LLMs) into tangible, precise physical actions. This chapter bridges the critical gap between high-level cognitive planning derived from LLM outputs and the low-level, real-time execution capabilities offered by ROS 2 actions.

You will gain essential skills in effectively converting the rich, semantic outputs of LLMs into actionable ROS 2 topics and services, enabling your humanoid robot to interpret and execute complex commands. We will explore the integration of a library of predefined robot skills—such as dynamic walking to a specified location, intelligent navigation around static and moving obstacles, robust object detection and identification, and dexterous pick-and-place operations. Crucially, all these integrations will be rigorously tested within simulation environments to ensure the robust, reliable, and safe robot behavior demanded by intelligent physical systems. This chapter provides the practical framework for your humanoid robot to translate thought into effective physical interaction.
