# Chapter 5: URDF for Humanoid Robot Modeling in Physical AI

Accurate physical representation is fundamental for both the simulation and real-world deployment of Physical AI and humanoid robots. This chapter focuses on URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), the cornerstone for describing a robot's kinematics, visual appearance, and crucial collision properties. You will learn the intricate URDF structure and syntax, empowering you to precisely define the physical characteristics of your humanoid robot.

We will cover how to define links (the rigid bodies of the robot) and joints (the connections between them), crucial for understanding and controlling robot motion. You'll also learn to add visual and collision meshes, which are vital for realistic rendering in simulation and for enabling collision detection and avoidance algorithms in intelligent physical systems. The chapter will also introduce Xacro for modular URDF creation, allowing for scalable and reusable robot descriptions. Technical topics include the URDF XML format, a deep dive into `<link>`, `<joint>`, `<visual>`, and `<collision>` tags, and the power of Xacro macros. Hands-on exercises will involve creating a URDF for a simple multi-DOF robotic arm (a common component of humanoids) and extending an existing humanoid URDF with a new sensor mount, providing practical experience in building the digital twin necessary for advanced Physical AI development and control.
