# Chapter 6: ROS 2 Launch for Orchestrating Physical AI Systems

The true power of Physical AI and humanoid robotics often lies in the harmonious coordination of numerous interacting components. This chapter focuses on ROS 2 launch files, the essential tool for orchestrating complex multi-node robot systems. You will learn how to design and write robust Python launch files to define, configure, and manage the simultaneous startup of all software modules that comprise your intelligent robot.

We will explore how to group related nodes (e.g., perception, planning, control), set parameters dynamically for different operational modes, and implement conditional launching and event handling to create adaptive and resilient robotic applications. Effective debugging of launch files is also a critical skill for rapid development and deployment of physical AI systems. Technical topics include `launch.py` (Python-based launch files), and the strategic use of `<Node>`, `<Group>`, `<Param>`, `<Include>`, and `<OpaqueFunction>` tags to build scalable and maintainable robot configurations. Hands-on exercises will involve creating a launch file to start a comprehensive multi-node humanoid robot application (simulated or real) and debugging a failing launch sequence, providing practical experience in bringing intelligent physical systems to life.
