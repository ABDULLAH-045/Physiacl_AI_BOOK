# Chapter 8: Capstone: Building a Humanoid Nervous System for Physical AI

This capstone chapter serves as the culmination of your journey through the ROS 2 module. It guides you through synthesizing all the learned concepts—from nodes and topics to services, actions, URDF, and AI integration—to construct a foundational ROS 2 system capable of powering a humanoid robot and enabling basic Physical AI.

You will apply principles of end-to-end ROS 2 system design, focusing on the sophisticated orchestration of multiple components to achieve integrated robotic intelligence. The chapter emphasizes the critical skills of testing and debugging complex robot applications, ensuring the reliability and robustness required for physical interaction. By reviewing all concepts covered in this module, you will engage in exercises that culminate in assembling a complete, intelligent ROS 2 stack for a humanoid robot, demonstrating its ability to perform basic sensing, make autonomous decisions, and execute precise actuations within a physical environment. This hands-on experience will solidify your understanding of how ROS 2 forms the essential "nervous system" for emergent Physical AI behaviors.
