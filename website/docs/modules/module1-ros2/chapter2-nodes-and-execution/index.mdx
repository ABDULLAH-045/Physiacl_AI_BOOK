# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes & Execution Model for Physical AI

In the development of Physical AI and humanoid robots, the ability to break down complex behaviors into manageable, independent components is critical. This chapter delves into the core concept of ROS 2 Nodes, which are the fundamental building blocks for modular robot components. You will learn how to design, implement, and manage these nodes to create responsive and robust humanoid systems.

We will explore the node lifecycle, rate control, and callbacks—mechanisms vital for coordinating diverse robotic functions, from sensor processing to motor control. Understanding how to compose nodes is key to developing complex humanoid behaviors and integrating advanced AI algorithms seamlessly. Technical topics covered include `rclpy.Node` for Python-based development, timers and callback groups for precise timing and execution, and multi-threaded executors for optimizing performance in real-time robotic applications. Hands-on exercises will involve building a heartbeat node that publishes robot "vitals" (simulating internal state for AI monitoring) and a subscriber that logs sensor data (essential for environmental perception), providing practical experience in building the intelligent control systems that drive physical AI.
