# Chapter 4: Services & Actions for Orchestrating Physical AI Behaviors

To achieve truly intelligent and autonomous behavior in humanoid robotics and Physical AI, robots need to execute complex tasks that often involve precise sequencing, feedback, and long-duration operations. This chapter delves into the implementation of request-response and long-running goal patterns using ROS 2 services and actions, respectively.

You will learn the key differences between topics (for continuous data streams), services (for immediate, single-shot requests), and actions (for asynchronous, goal-oriented tasks with feedback), and how to strategically apply each to orchestrate sophisticated robot behaviors. We will explore how ROS 2 services can be used for immediate, critical tasks like triggering safety stops or querying system states, while actions provide the framework for more intricate, multi-step operations such as navigating to a location, manipulating objects, or executing gait patterns in a humanoid.

Technical topics include `rclpy.Service` and `rclpy.Action`, covering the creation and interaction of service and action servers and clients. Hands-on exercises will involve creating a service to trigger a humanoid robot's pose reset (a common safety or initialization procedure) and implementing an action to make the robot walk a specific distance or perform a complex manipulation sequence, providing practical experience in commanding and coordinating the physical actions of intelligent robots.
