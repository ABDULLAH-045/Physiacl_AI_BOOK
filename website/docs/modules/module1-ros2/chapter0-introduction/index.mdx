# Introduction to The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) for Humanoid Robotics and Physical AI

Welcome to the foundational module of your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This chapter introduces the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the "nervous system" enabling complex humanoid robots to perceive, process, and interact with the physical world.

You will learn how ROS 2 facilitates seamless communication, robust sensing, and precise actuation in real-world scenarios. We'll explore its distributed middleware architecture and master core concepts like nodes, topics, and services, all crucial for building the intelligent, physically embodied agents of tomorrow.
