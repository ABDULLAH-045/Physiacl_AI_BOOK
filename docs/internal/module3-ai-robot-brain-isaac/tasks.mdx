# Tasks: Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Feature**: `3-ai-robot-brain-isaac`
**Version**: 1.0.0

This document outlines the implementation tasks for the NVIDIA Isaac™ module.

## Phase 1: Isaac Sim Setup

-   [ ] T001 Install NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher and Isaac Sim
-   [ ] T002 Import a basic humanoid URDF into Isaac Sim
-   [ ] T003 Configure a simple scene with basic physics

## Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation

-   [ ] T004 Add camera sensors to the simulated humanoid
-   [ ] T005 Implement basic domain randomization
-   [ ] T006 Generate and export a small labeled synthetic dataset

## Phase 3: Isaac ROS Perception

-   [ ] T007 Set up Isaac ROS development environment (Docker)
-   [ ] T008 Implement and test Isaac ROS VSLAM pipeline
-   [ ] T009 Integrate Isaac Sim sensor data with Isaac ROS

## Phase 4: Nav2 Integration

-   [ ] T010 Adapt Nav2 configuration for bipedal movement
-   [ ] T011 Implement mapping and localization using VSLAM
-   [ ] T012 Configure path planning and obstacle avoidance

## Phase 5: AI Model Deployment

-   [ ] T013 Conceptual task: Train a simple AI model
-   [ ] T014 Convert a trained AI model to ONNX format
-   [ ] T015 Deploy the ONNX model within a ROS 2 node

## Final Phase: Documentation & Verification

-   [ ] T016 Review and lint all conceptual code snippets.
-   [ ] T017 Review and format all Markdown documentation.
-   [ ] T018 Verify that all conceptual examples align with the book's narrative.
