# Tasks: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Feature**: `4-vision-language-action`
**Version**: 1.0.0

This document outlines the implementation tasks for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module.

## Phase 1: Voice Control (Whisper)

-   [ ] T001 Set up a ROS 2 node for Whisper speech-to-text inference.
-   [ ] T002 Implement custom vocabulary for voice commands.
-   [ ] T003 Test and verify speech-to-text accuracy.

## Phase 2: LLM Task Planning

-   [ ] T004 Integrate an LLM for natural language command processing.
-   [ ] T005 Define and implement a set of robot action primitives.
-   [ ] T006 Implement LLM prompting strategy for cognitive plan generation.
-   [ ] T007 Develop safety and feasibility checks for LLM-generated plans.

## Phase 3: Vision for Perception

-   [ ] T008 Integrate vision modules (e.g., object detection, pose estimation).
-   [ ] T009 Implement object recognition and localization in simulation.

## Phase 4: Action Execution & Orchestration

-   [ ] T010 Develop a ROS 2 node for executing LLM-generated action primitives.
-   [ ] T011 Implement feedback mechanisms for action success/failure.
-   [ ] T012 Orchestrate the full VLA pipeline from voice to action.

## Phase 5: Capstone Project

-   [ ] T013 Set up a simulated task environment.
-   [ ] T014 Demonstrate voice command to task completion for a complex task.

## Final Phase: Documentation & Verification

-   [ ] T015 Review and lint all conceptual code snippets.
-   [ ] T016 Review and format all Markdown documentation.
-   [ ] T017 Verify that all conceptual examples align with the book's narrative.
