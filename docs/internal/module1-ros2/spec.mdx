# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Send Simple Commands (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to send basic movement commands to a robot through ROS 2, so that I can understand how messages travel between nodes.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental interaction and serves as the "Hello, World!" for robotics.

**Independent Test**: The student can run a command-line publisher to send a `Twist` message to the `/cmd_vel` topic and see the message received by a subscriber.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running ROS 2 environment, **When** the user publishes a `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` message to the `/cmd_vel` topic, **Then** a subscriber listening to that topic should receive and print the message.

---

### User Story 2 - See Robot Response (Priority: P2)

As a learner, I want the robot in simulation to visually respond to my commands, so that I can confirm that communication is working correctly.

**Why this priority**: Visual feedback is critical for reinforcing learning and debugging.

**Independent Test**: When a `Twist` message is published to `/cmd_vel`, the simulated robot should move in Gazebo.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulated robot is running in Gazebo and subscribed to `/cmd_vel`, **When** a `Twist` message with a positive `linear.x` value is published, **Then** the robot model should move forward in the simulation.

---

### User Story 3 - Understand Publisher & Subscriber (Priority: P3)

As a beginner, I want to create a publisher and subscriber node, so that I can learn the core communication pattern in ROS 2.

**Why this priority**: This is a core competency for any ROS 2 developer.

**Independent Test**: The student can write a Python script for a publisher node and another for a subscriber node that successfully exchange messages on a custom topic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has written a publisher node script, **When** they run the node, **Then** it should continuously publish messages to a specified topic.
2. **Given** a student has written a subscriber node script, **When** they run the node, **Then** it should subscribe to the specified topic and print the messages it receives.

---

### User Story 4 - Handle Node Crashes (Priority: P4)

As a student, I want my nodes to restart automatically when they fail, so that my project keeps working without manually relaunching everything.

**Why this priority**: Introduces the concept of robustness and launch files.

**Independent Test**: A node can be manually killed, and the ROS 2 launch system should automatically restart it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a set of nodes is started with a launch file that has the `respawn` attribute set to `true`, **When** one of the managed nodes is manually terminated, **Then** the launch system should detect the failure and restart the node within a few seconds.

---

### User Story 5 - Use Topics for Safe Messaging (Priority: P5)

As a learner, I want to use topics to send messages safely between nodes, so that I understand how ROS 2 avoids direct coupling.

**Why this priority**: This reinforces a key architectural principle of ROS 2.

**Independent Test**: Two nodes can communicate without having any direct reference to each other, only a shared topic name and message type.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a publisher and subscriber node, **When** the publisher is shut down, **Then** the subscriber should continue to run without errors.

---

### User Story 6 - Monitor Robot State (Priority: P6)

As a student, I want to subscribe to the robot’s joint states, so that I can read what the robot is doing at any moment.

**Why this priority**: This is fundamental for building closed-loop control systems.

**Independent Test**: A student can run a subscriber node that listens to the `/joint_states` topic and prints the position of each joint.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulated robot is running, **When** a user subscribes to the `/joint_states` topic, **Then** they should receive `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` messages containing the current position of the robot's joints.

---

### User Story 7 - Test Real-Time Behavior (Priority: P7)

As a beginner, I want to see how fast the robot reacts, so that I understand real-time constraints and latency in ROS 2.

**Why this priority**: Introduces the important concept of real-time performance in robotics.

**Independent Test**: A student can measure the time between publishing a command and seeing the robot's state change in the `/joint_states` topic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system to publish a command and subscribe to `/joint_states`, **When** a command is sent, **Then** the measured latency should be logged and fall within an expected range (e.g., under 200ms).

---

### User Story 8 - Control a Simple Arm Joint (Priority: P8)

As a student, I want to control at least one robot joint, so that I can learn the basics of actuator control in ROS 2.

**Why this priority**: Moves from simple mobile base control to manipulator control.

**Independent Test**: A student can publish a message to a topic that controls a single joint of a robot arm, causing it to move.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulated robot arm, **When** a user publishes a `std_msgs/msg/Float64` message to a joint controller topic, **Then** the corresponding joint should move to the commanded position.

---

### User Story 9 - Understand ROS 2 Nodes (Priority: P9)

As a learner, I want to understand how nodes communicate in a robotics system, so that I can build more advanced robot behaviors later.

**Why this priority**: This is a conceptual goal that is achieved by completing the other user stories.

**Independent Test**: A student can draw a diagram of the ROS 2 graph for their project, showing the nodes, topics, and messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running multi-node system, **When** a student uses the `ros2 node list`, `ros2 topic list`, and `ros2 service list` commands, **Then** they can accurately describe the communication architecture.

---

### User Story 10 - Work in Simulation Safely (Priority: P10)

As a beginner, I want to test everything in a simulator, so that I can learn robotics safely without breaking hardware.

**Why this priority**: Simulation is a critical and non-negotiable part of modern robotics development.

**Independent Test**: All previous user stories can be completed within the Gazebo simulator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project code, **When** a student runs the provided launch files, **Then** the entire system (robot model, controllers, nodes) should launch correctly in Gazebo without requiring physical hardware.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if a required ROS 2 topic is not published (e.g., `/cmd_vel` stops)? The system should handle this gracefully, perhaps by stopping robot movement or logging a warning.
-   How does the system handle an invalid `Twist` message (e.g., NaN values for linear/angular velocities)? The receiving node should validate inputs and reject/ignore invalid commands.
-   What happens if the simulated robot encounters an obstacle that causes it to flip or get stuck? The simulation should accurately reflect the physics, and the robot's state (`/joint_states`) should update accordingly.
-   How does the system behave if a node attempts to subscribe to a non-existent topic? ROS 2 should not crash, and the subscriber node should log a warning or error.
-   What if the launch file tries to respawn a node that continuously crashes (e.g., due to a persistent bug)? The launch system should ideally have a retry limit or back-off mechanism to prevent an infinite crash-respawn loop.
